    <p>Hey, I'm Lawrence Murry, Founder of Song Chordz. I created Song Chordz as a way to have a fast and easy access to tons of popular, contemporary, 
	and traditional song chords for beginning to intermediate ear-trained keyboard players.</p>
	<p>Why purchase our chordz? I have a deep passion for music and playing the keyboad. A ear-traind keyboard player myself, I've been honing craft 
	for 16 years. I've played mostly in church and school events while in college. My goal is to help you and other musicians expand and grow your talent.</p>
